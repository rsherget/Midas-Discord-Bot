# Chat Bot

# Midas Discord Bot

## About The Bot

This project was created by myself and two other group members (Andrew Edwards and Anu Shittu) for our software engineering capstone project. This bot idea came to be as we all use discord to communicate and we wanted to create something we could use in our discord server while also expanding our knowledge of using APIs and also just because it sounded fun. 

This is a self-hosted, multi-purpose discord bot with basic moderation capabilities as well as the ability to utilize chat-gpt and relay real-time stock data and make trades. It also has the ability to auto trade stocks where you pick the stock for the bot to monitor and if conditions are met then the bot will buy/sell the stock without further prompt from the user.

ðŸ”´ **PLEASE READ BEFORE USE!** ðŸ”´ If used in a server with multiple people and you plan on using the trading aspects with real money not paper money, I advise you look up trading laws related to multiple people utilizing one trading account. We are computer science majors, not law majors so we have no idea what the law says about this. We recommend using a paper money account for this reason :)

## Getting started

Clone this to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/rsherget/Midas-Discord-Bot.git`.
